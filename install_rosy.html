	<p><span class="MainHeading">Installation Guide</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">This guide provides instructions for the installation of the 
	parts that make up the original Waconia: the data gleaners, 
	the database, and the <a class="page" href="gleaners/rosy.html">rosy.asp</a> charting page. The end result is a gleaning 
	and charting process that runs on your local network, periodically using 
	your internet connection to glean weather data. A web browser is used to access the rosy.asp web page 
	(from any computer on your local network) and present the data in charts.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Note that I cannot recommend serving this out through 
	your local-network firewall. It's just fine to do this on an internal 
	network. But this all might pose a security risk to the host computer if the 
	Waconia web site is accessible from the internet. Having said that (my 
	disclaimer), I did exactly that for about 20 years and served this site out 
	through two different company firewalls. Never had a problem.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">It is best if you have:</p>
	<ul class="indent-2">
		<li>A Windows computer (7, 8, or 10)<ul>
			<li>It will need to be on all the time (so the gleaners can run)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Installations (needed, but not covered here):<ul>
				<li>Microsoft Access</li>
				<li>Python 2</li>
				<li>Perl (optional, but needed if you want to use the two 
				gleaners that are written in Perl)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Some basic experience with:<ul>
			<li>Microsoft's web server (IIS)</li>
			<li>Setting folder permissions</li>
			<li>A script-file editor (like
			<a class="page" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="indent-1">Note that in 2023 I added features to the gleaners so 
	that they can write to the Google spreadsheets which are the data source for 
	the <a class="page" href="weather.html">new</a> charting page. Also, the 
	Perl gleaner that collects readings from the HMS site, now uses secondary 
	Python scripts that facilitate the page fetch and the post to the sheet. 
	These features will only work if there is a target Google sheet. So for the 
	gleaners to behave as they did for the original web site, those sections of 
	the code should be disabled (commented). Someday (TBD) I may add to this 
	page to include instructions to support the new charting page.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">What follows is relative to Windows 10, but much of this 
	stuff is very similar in Windows 7 and 8. If you've had a good breakfast, 
	this installation exercise might serve as a&nbsp;useful introduction to server-sided 
	scripting. This is not an extremely detailed walkthrough. It will cover the 
	needed steps and should be enough to get you 
	up and running.</p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Get the files you will need</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Create a new folder called &quot;webcontent&quot; in your 
	documents area of Windows. Download the waconia.zip file at this
	<a class="page" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByxaBWklPKdjQWJaX0tNOVdMRms">
	Google-drive</a> link. Unzip it and then copy or move the waconia folder 
	(and everything in it) so as to be a subfolder in the webcontent folder. So 
	the path to the website-dev folder should look something like this (of 
	course the username in the path should be changed):<br>
	C:\Users\Jim\Documents\webcontent\waconia\website-dev</p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Install IIS</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">IIS is part of Windows 10; it needs to be enabled (turn on the feature). 
	Also check the ASP option (see yellow highlight).</p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	<img alt="" height="593" src="pictures/IIS-ASP.png" width="413"></p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Configure IIS for Classic ASP and 32 bit 
	processes</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Open up the IIS manager (click on the Windows icon in 
	the start menu and then type IIS).</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Add a new application pool. Call it &quot;oldASP&quot;.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="223" src="pictures/CreateAppPool.png" width="383"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Host the application in a &quot;Classic&quot; 
	pipeline-mode application pool. Choose &quot;No Managed Code&quot; and &quot;Classic&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" height="278" src="pictures/Edit%20Application%20Pool.png" width="301"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">In the &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; of your oldASP application pool, set 
	&quot;Enable 32-Bit Applications&quot; to True.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="541" src="pictures/32bitMode.png" width="434"></p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Add applications under the default website 
	in IIS</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">&nbsp;In the IIS manager, right-click on the &quot;Default Web 
	Site&quot; and choose to &quot;add an Application.&quot;</p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	<img alt="" height="598" src="pictures/application.jpg" width="534"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">For your development site, enter &quot;waconia-dev&quot; (fill in 
	the Alias field). Then provide the path to the development folder that 
	contains the rosy.asp. So for example, my path string is &quot;C:\Users\Jim\Documents\webcontent\waconia\website-dev&quot;. 
	Select the oldASP application pool.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">To force detailed-error reporting, open 
	the ASP feature (double-click on the ASP icon) for the website.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="288" src="pictures/asp-feature.png" width="427"><br><br>
	Then expand the &quot;Debugging Properties&quot; node. Set &quot;Send Errors To Browser&quot; to 
	True.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="602" src="pictures/send-errors.png" width="729"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">You may want to repeat this section for a production 
	site (that you publish to) and call this production site simply 
	&quot;waconia&quot;. Enter a path string here that points to the production folder. 
	Again, select the oldASP application pool.</p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Install and test the ASPChart software</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1"><span class="SectionHeading-2">Register the ASPChart dll:</span></p>
	<ol class="indent-2">
		<li>Copy the aspchart.dll file from the ASPChart-install-files folder 
		and put it in this folder:&nbsp;
		C:\Windows\SysWOW64<br></li>
		<li>Type &quot;cmd&quot; from the windows menu. Right click on the &quot;Command 
		Prompt&quot; option. Then choose to open a command 
		window as an administrator.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<img alt="" height="286" src="pictures/cmd-admin.png" width="347"><br>
		<br>Then from that administrator window, run the following command:<strong><br>
		C:\Windows\SysWOW64\regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\SysWOW64\aspchart.dll
		</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="indent-1"><span class="SectionHeading-2">Add the license code to your registry:</span></p>
	<ol class="indent-2">
		<li>Open regedit (from the Windows menu, type &quot;regedit&quot;)<br></li>
		<li>Use import feature of regedit (File/Import) to load in the 
		aspchart-regkey.reg file from the ASPChart-install-files folder. There's nothing scary in there, just a license 
		code. Here's an image of what's in the file.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<img alt="" height="166" src="pictures/reg-key.png" width="953"></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="indent-1"><span class="SectionHeading-2">Set security permissions 
	on the chart-images folder:</span></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">You have to give your webbrowser permission to write 
	to the chart-images folder. So give both the IIS_IUSRS and IUSR users 
	&quot;Modify&quot; level of permissions. <br><br>
	<img alt="" height="649" src="pictures/permissions.png" width="521"></p>
	<p class="indent-1"><span class="SectionHeading-2">Test it:</span></p>
	<ol class="indent-2">
		<li>Test your general ASP setup from a web browser (use your own local 
		IP address and site name). This page will check to see if ASP content 
		can run on your web server.<br>
		http://192.168.1.106/waconia-dev/whatserveristhis.asp<br><br>It should 
		look something like this:<br><br>
		<img alt="" height="159" src="pictures/ASP-test.png" width="312"><br>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Test your AspChart installation from a web browser. This page will 
		test the AspChart dll and the permissions set on the chart-images 
		folder.<br>http://192.168.1.106/waconia-dev/aspchart-test.asp&nbsp; <br>
		<br>(Here's a look at the <a class="page" href="gleaners/ASPChart-test.asp.html">ASP 
		code</a> for this test page.)<br><br>The page should render something 
		like this:<br><br>
		<img alt="" height="549" src="pictures/AspChart-test-chart.png" width="609"></li>
	</ol>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Set permissions for the data folder</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">In a way similar to what was done for the chart-images 
	folder, give both the IIS_IUSRS and IUSR users &quot;Modify&quot; level of permissions 
	on the &quot;data&quot; folder. You might be tempted to use a lower level of authority 
	here because you will only be reading (querying) the database, but MS Access 
	is picky about variation in authority levels between users. Problems can 
	occur if you have a network user querying the database while you (as an 
	administrator) are interacting with the database on the host machine. Just 
	use the &quot;Modify&quot; level.</p>
	<p class="SectionHeading-1">Edit the headers.asp file</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Open the headers.asp file in an editor. Change the name 
	values in the following lines of code (change &quot;NUC&quot; and the IP address). 
	Also change the path to the telem.mdb database.<br></p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	<img alt="" height="96" src="pictures/headers.png" width="1342"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	If using MS Office 365:</p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	<img alt="" src="pictures/connectstring.gif"></p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Test and schedule the gleaners</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Each of the four gleaner scripts has a single line of 
	code that establishes the path to the database. Edit this DSN string in each 
	file to reflect your path to the telem.mdb database.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">
	<img alt="" height="54" src="pictures/databasepath.png" width="1007"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Try running each of the four gleaners from a Windows 
	command prompt. These will send text to the command window indicating 
	progress. The gleaners will not run correctly unless you have the necessary 
	Perl and Python modules installed (see the top of each file) and the paths 
	to the database have been updated (edited) in each file.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="373" src="pictures/gleaner-test.png" width="469"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Make a scheduled task for the geturl_NUC.bat batch file.<br>
	<br><img alt="" height="706" src="pictures/scheduled-task.png" width="950"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Set the trigger to fire every five minutes.<br><br>
	<img alt="" height="699" src="pictures/scheduled-triggers.png" width="640"></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Set the path to the target file (geturl_NUC.bat) that 
	will run periodically.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<img alt="" height="482" src="pictures/scheduled-target.png" width="634"></p>
	<p><span class="SectionHeading-1">Enjoy your website</span></p>
	<p class="indent-1">Now try entring a URL (something like this one) into 
	your browser: <br>
	http://192.168.1.106/waconia-dev/rosy.asp?Region=MN<br>Of course use 
	your actual local-network IP address and your site name in the URL. Then 
	just interact with the chart controls at the top of the web page.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Wow, you have made it to the enjoyment section. 
	Nice job! That was a lot of settings to get right.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">There's not much to do as far as maintenance. Someday 
	you might need to check the log files in the waconia folder...</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Soon, you may want to add a new weather station to your 
	gleaning process. There are two spots where you have to specify a new 
	station: at the end of the appropriate gleaner-script file, and in the StationNames table in the database.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Have fun looking at your custom weather data site. My 
	neice Chelsea once said I'm like her dad (my brother Dave) in my interest in 
	weather data. (You could substitute &quot;obsession with&quot; for &quot;interest in&quot; here. 
	I kind of think that's what she was thinking.)</p>
	<p class="indent-1">If you have some luck with this (or not), I'll respond 
	to e-mail sent to my contact email address.</p>
	<p class="indent-1">Here's what your single-day charts will look like once 
	you're up and running:</p>
