	<p><a name="PastAndFuture"></a>What's the past and present for this site?&nbsp;
	<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">For nearly 20 years Waconia had been hosted by 
   <a class="page" href="https://www.pnnl.gov/">PNNL</a> or 
   <a class="page" href="https://www.gustavus.edu/">Gustavus</a>.
   With my retirement, came an end to this free hosting for the 
	database and the server-sided scripting that was behind the charting page. 
	(If you would like to host Waconia inside your local network, here is the
	<a class="page" href="install_rosy.html">installation guide</a>.)</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Now there's a 
	<a class="page" href="https://waconia.triquence.org/weather.html?station=KRLD&amp;days=5">client</a> page built 
	around <a class="page" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a>. 
	It queries weather data stored in
	Google spreadsheets (cloud). All client sided; all without hosting costs.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The gleaner <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="DataSources" href="#">scripts</a> 
	continue to run, now 
	feeding the Google spreadsheets, still hosted on a little Intel NUC 
	existing quietly on my home network.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The scripts also feed a local database for my 
	at-home version of the old Waconia. So the old site lives on in the comfort 
	of my basement. The current sample charts are produced by posting to this 
	at-home Waconia and then publishing (to a hosting service) the resulting chart images in a static html page
	(yes, another <a class="page" href="gleaners/getChartsFor50webs.html">Python script</a>).</p>

      <p>First you'll need to <a class="page" href="install_rosy.html">
      install</a> some stuff to support the gleaners and the
      <a class="page" href="gleaners/rosy.html">rosy.asp</a> charting page. Then come back 
      here...</p>
      <p>Use the five drop-down lists to control what data is presented. Click 
         the &quot;Update&quot; button to refresh the plot.&nbsp;The drop-down lists 
         set the following parameters (from left to right):</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Region</b>: Pick a region. This selection affects the location 
            options.</li>
         <li><b>Location</b>:&nbsp; Select from any of the listed weather monitoring 
            sites.</li>
         <li><b>Sensor</b>:&nbsp; Select wind (default), temperature, pressure, 
            or delta-pressure (available on for the Columbia Basin sites). </li>
         <li><b>End date</b>:&nbsp; Select the last day of data to be shown in 
            the chart (default is today).</li>
         <li>&quot;<b>Days</b>&quot;:&nbsp; Select the total number of days to 
            be presented in the chart (default is 1).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The &quot;<b>&lt;</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>&gt;</b>&quot; buttons (to the 
         right of the &quot;Days&quot; control) step the chart backward (&quot;<b>&lt;</b>&quot;) 
         or forward (&quot;<b>&gt;</b>&quot;) in time. The size of the step is determined 
         by the value of the &quot;Days&quot; control. The &quot;<b>&gt;</b>&quot; 
      button (to the right of the stations select list) acts to step through the 
      stations list.</p>
      <p>Select the &quot;24h&quot; checkbox to display 
      single-day data in the <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="24hrPlot" href="#">24-hour mode</a>. When viewing 
      today's data, this mode will present the most recent 24 hours of readings, 
      including some of yesterday's data.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>You can set Waconia to auto-refresh every 5 minutes by selecting the &quot;Timer&quot; 
		checkbox. This feature automatically syncs your browser to refresh 
		10 seconds after the 5-minute updates on the Whitebear server and insures 
		that you have the freshest data available. Another useful indicator is the 
		difference (in minutes) between the current time and the time stamp on the 
		latest data record. This is shown in the last set of parentheses in the 
		string of numbers to the right of the home link.</p>
	</blockquote>
	
   <p><a name="24hrPlot"></a>What is the &quot;24h&quot; checkbox?&nbsp; <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">
	top</a></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Selecting this option enables the 24-hour mode for 
	the 1-day plot. This displays the most recent 24 hours of data including readings from 
	yesterday. The effect of this mode is only 
	apparent when selecting the most recent day in the day list.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">There are two black vertical lines that indicate the time of the 
	most recent reading (left line) and the current time (right line). The 
	distance between these two lines indicates the age of the most recent data. 
	Note that this &quot;age&quot; is also indicated by the minutes in parentheses 
	() just to 
	right of the server time. Readings from yesterday are displayed to the 
	right of the most-recent-reading line. Yesterday's data is indicated with 
	thinner trace lines and the direction markers are gray.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Why do this? First, it gives you a complete diurnal 
	cycle in one consistant view. Also, it presents a contrast between today's 
	latest reading and what was happening at that same time yesterday. The two 
	vertical lines give a quick visual indication of the lag in the most recent 
	reading. You can think of the left-vertical line as painting over 
	yesterday's data as the day progresses (as it slowly moves from left to 
	right throughout the day).</p>
	
   <p><a name="RunningAverage"></a>What is the &quot;RA&quot; checkbox?&nbsp; <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">
	top</a></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Selecting this option smooths the data with a 3-point 
	running average. This feature uses a special technique to deal with 
	near-North wind-direction data. It converts individual wind-direction 
	observations into x and y components, averages the components, then 
	calculates the wind direction from the component averages.</p>
	<p><a name="theURL"></a>What is all that stuff in the URL (web address)?&nbsp;
	<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The URL (web page address) is now parameterized. This 
	allows you to e-mail a link for a particular day and location, or to save a 
	shortcut that will give you the latest data at your favorite site.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">To create a URL that gives the latest data, just trim 
	the URL back to the sensor parameter. For example, here is a URL string for the latest wind data 
		for the Faribault, MN airport:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">

	<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Charts of two or more days of data will show hourly aggregates of the 
		raw 15-minute data. For example,&nbsp; if the HMS web site presents data 
		at 14:00, 14:15, 14:30, and 14:45, the chart will represent those four points 
		with a single aggregate point at 2 p.m. PST (14/24 = 0.583 day fraction).</p>

   <p><a name="9"></a>What data is shown in the table?&nbsp; <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The table at the top shows today's latest reading for the selected site.&nbsp;This 
		is a raw fifteen minute reading and is equivalent to the current data shown 
		at the source site. It is also equivalent to the last point on a one-day 
		chart.</p>
	</blockquote>
	
   <p><a name="3"></a>How should I interpret the time axis?&nbsp;<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A data point at 2:15 p.m. is an aggregate of high-frequency sampling 
			during the 15-minutes prior to the 2:15 timestamp of the report.&nbsp; 
			In other words, a point at 2:15 reflects conditions between 2:00 p.m. 
			and 2:15 p.m. </li>
			<li>When charting more than one day, the axis converts to a day format 
			and the charted points are hourly aggregates.&nbsp; A point at the half-day 
			mark corresponds with an aggregate of the 12th hour (12n = 12 noon) 
			reports (that is, conditions between noon and 1 p.m.).&nbsp; A point 
			at the day mark corresponds to the 0th hour (12 midnight) reports (that 
			is, conditions between midnight and 1 a.m.). </li>
			<li>In the summer, day light savings time is automatically taken into account.
            <ul>
               <li>Timestamps in the table, both the server time and the &quot;latest 
               reading&quot; time, indicate day light savings time with a &quot;PDT&quot; 
               (Pacific Daylight Time).&nbsp; A &quot;PST&quot; indicates Pacific 
               Standard Time. </li>
               <li>Whether the chart itself uses PST or PDT is determined by the 
               end time of the chart selected.&nbsp; Multi-day charts that <u>end</u> 
               with a date within PDT will use (for the whole chart) PDT time values.
               </li>
               <li>For the curious out there, the database is all recorded in PST.&nbsp; 
               Code in the ASP page handles the conversion to PDT when needed for 
               clarity to the user. </li>
            </ul>

   <p><a name="yaxis2"></a>When plotting wind speed, what is the secondary-y axis?&nbsp;<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The y-axis on the right side of the plot is for wind 
	direction. This scale is used to determine the values of the square point 
	markers. Also see the discussion in the next FAQ.</p>
	<p><a name="windoptions"></a>Why are there two wind options, Wind (0-36) and Wind (0-40)?&nbsp;
	<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Both options provide wind direction and wind speed information. The direction 
		is defined by the secondary y-axis on the right side of the chart.</p>
		<p>The 0-40 option is the most used wind direction charting option. In this 
		case the direction data is scaled so that the compass points correspond 
		with the 5 mph grid lines on the chart.</p>
		<p>The 0-36 option is a good choice for people that are comfortable thinking 
		of direction in terms of degrees (0-360). 180 degrees on the right axis 
		corresponds with 18 mph on the left axis; a scaling factor of 1/10. One 
		frequent user, a sailplane pilot, prefers this wind charting option.</p>
		<p>In either case, the secondary-y axis makes it straightforward to interpret 
		the direction data.</p>
		<p>For the curious, some history and development details: The chart-image&nbsp;module 
		used in Waconia (ASPChart) unfortunately does not have an option for a secondary 
		y-axis. The secondary axis that you currently see is actually a hand-built 
		static image (a transparent gif), overlaid on the chart. Through the magic 
		of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the two images are revealed simultaneously 
		to the give the appearance of a single image. In earlier releases of Waconia, 
		a simple compromise (using no secondary axis and no overlay image) was&nbsp;implemented, 
		through which&nbsp;the wind-direction data was&nbsp;scaled by the ratio 
		40/360 (for the 0-40 option)&nbsp;or 1/10 (for the 0-36 option). Without 
		a secondary axis, the user was left to interpret the direction points using 
		only the speed axis and the clues in the image legend. Thanks to the image 
		overlay in the current release, the legend has now been simplified; it's 
		way better.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>There is an image scaling feature for the wind, temperature and delta-p 
		charts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the wind exceeds 40 mph, the number of pixels in the chart scales 
			(grows) with the max speed in the chart; this give an accurate visual 
			impression of those big wind days.&nbsp; This feature is especially 
			useful when you look at the wind up on Rattlesnake mountain. </li>
			<li>For the temperature chart, the auto scaling is based on the difference 
			between the minimum and maximum points.&nbsp; If this differential exceeds&nbsp;40 
			degrees, the number of pixels (along the temperature axis) scales with 
			the differential.&nbsp; If the differential is less than&nbsp;40 degrees, 
			the data is centered within the&nbsp;40 degrees of range of the temperature 
			axis. </li>
			<li>For the delta-p chart, if the min to max range exceeds 0.26 (the 
			default range on the y axis), the charts image size scales. </li>

   <p><a name="11"></a>What is the delta-P charting option (Columbia Basin sites)?&nbsp;<a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This option plots differential pressures between four sites: Portland, 
		The Dalles, Roosevelt, and Richland. The differentials are defined in the 
		chart legend. For example, the trace named &quot;Portland - The Dalles&quot; 
		is calculated as the pressure difference between Portland and TheDalles 
		(using sea-level corrected pressures).</p>
		<p>Pressure differentials can be useful in predicting wind at Roosevelt 
		WA. Pressure gradients often move from west to east so a good differential 
		between Portland and The Dalles can be a good indicator of wind to come 
		at Rosy. Differentials over about 0.05 inches Hg generally indicate sailable 
		wind.</p>

   <p><a name="7"></a>How is the direction data aggregated, especially when the wind is out of the north?&nbsp; <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="TOP" href="#">top</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>For charts of two or more days, I have not implemented a method for aggregating 
		near-North direction data (that is, directions that are bouncing back and 
		forth between slightly greater than 0 and slightly less than 360). So I 
		simply use the average of the 4 direction readings. This method can produce 
		an erroneous result of approximately 180 (or 20 using Waconia direction 
		notation) if the direction is near North (example:&nbsp; (3 + 359 + 2 + 
		358)/ 4 = 180.5).</p>
		<p>In the one-day charts this is not an issue because there is no aggregation 
		of the HMS 15-minute data.</p>
		<p>Note that the <a class="page scroll-link" data-scroll-target="RunningAverage" href="#">RA feature</a> properly 
		performs a running average on direction data for one-day charts.</p>
